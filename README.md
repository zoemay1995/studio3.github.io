Studio 3 focuses in on creating choropleth maps and adding interactivity to Mapbox web map applications. The first map is a customized choropleth map style that can be used as a style basis for population density maps. The second map adds several interactive elements to a basic Mapbox web map application including adding zoom-in/zoom-out capability, ability to fly to specific locations, a geocoder search bar, and a geolocation button. For the third and final map, analytical capabilities are added in order to get information on the data that it is being displayed.
